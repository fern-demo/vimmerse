All requests to the Vimmerse API require authentication via an API key passed in the `X-Api-Key` header.

## Getting your API key

To get a free API key, [contact the Vimmerse team](https://www.vimmerse.net/contact-us). Once you have your key, include it in every request.

<Warning>
Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

## Using your API key

Include the `X-Api-Key` header in every request:

<CodeBlocks>
```bash title="cURL"
curl -X GET https://api.vimmerse.net/media \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python title="Python"
import requests

headers = {"X-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
response = requests.get("https://api.vimmerse.net/media", headers=headers)
```

```javascript title="JavaScript"
const response = await fetch("https://api.vimmerse.net/media", {
  headers: { "X-Api-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
});
```
</CodeBlocks>

## Error responses

If authentication fails, the API returns:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `401` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | API key does not have permission for this resource |

## Best practices

- Store your API key in environment variables, not in source code
- Use a secrets manager in production environments
- Rotate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised
- Use separate API keys for development and production
